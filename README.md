## Person Detection model made using YOLOv8 

## Introduction
This repository hosts the implementation of a cutting-edge person detection model built using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework. Our model is designed to accurately detect and localize persons in images and videos with remarkable speed and precision.

## Key Features
YOLOv8 Architecture: Leveraging the power of the YOLOv8 architecture, our model achieves high detection accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.
Efficient Person Detection: With specialized training on person-centric datasets, our model excels at detecting individuals in various scenarios and environments.
Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrate our person detection model into your projects with well-documented code and straightforward usage instructions.
Scalable and Customizable: Whether you're working on a small-scale application or a large-scale deployment, our model is scalable and easily customizable to suit your needs.

## Inference
To inference the model just put this on your IDE and copy the relative path of the best.pt file to inf.py and place it on their respective place there's an example already there
